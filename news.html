				I ain't even trying to flex cuz your boy still broke, but this been a good year. When I turned 15, I ain't had no idea I was gonna be doing an EP, and getting payed to make beats for people. Not many other 15 year olds can say they out here grindin' just tryna make a few bucks doing what they love and it's working for them. <br /> You know, people like to label you. I got many labels that appear on my legal documents. Autistic. ADHD. Speach impaired. I got more than that too, but they don't matter in the music world. What am I in the music world? The Greatest Producer Alive, aka B00tleggerz. You can't beat that. I wouldn't trade that label for nothing. And I ain't changing for noone. Even the day I turn 16, imma keep producing all day cuz that's just how I do. If you got a problem with it, I would like to personaly invite you to kiss the seat of my pants.
